	<h2>Reviews</h2>
    <h3>The Lion King</h3>
        <blockquote>A jaw-dropping magnificent spectacle. The show and the playhouse are enchanting. The unprecedented production is worth every penny. If this is Disney's idea of a theme park, we are delighted to report that the theme is quality.</blockquote>
    <h3>Wicked</h3>
       <blockquote>"Wizard of Oz" fans will be fascinated by all the back stories, answering such questions as <q>"Is Glinda really that good?"</q> and <q>"Where did the flying monkeys come from?"</q> But the best thing about Wicked is its stars, whose talents cast a poweful spell.</blockquote>
    <h3>Jersey Boys</h3>
        <blockquote>A winner! Splendid actors and elegant strokes of observation. Direct pedal-to-the-metal stuff! The crowd goes wild. The energy is unstoppable!</blockquote>
